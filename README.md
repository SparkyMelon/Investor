# Investor

Investor is a website where compnaies can setup an advertising campaign for ivestors to invest in. 
It is aimed at smaller companies that are shadowed by much larger companies to give them a chance to break into the market.
The investors would gain back their investments plus a small bonus if the advertising was a success.

This project is still in development!

I am currently working on the profile page for investors. Basic login and registration is complete.

This project will not run properly on other devices as it needs a connection to a database, which is currently hard-coded.
